	abstract = {Male sexual behavior influences the rates of cervical dysplasia and invasive cervical cancer, as well as male human papillomavirus ({HPV}) infection and disease. Unfortunately, little is known regarding male {HPV} type distribution by age and across countries. In samples combined from the coronal sulcus, glans penis, shaft, and scrotum of 1,160 men from Brazil, Mexico, and the United States, overall {HPV} prevalence was 65.2\%, with 12.0\% oncogenic types only, 20.7\% nononcogenic types only, 17.8\% both oncogenic and nononcogenic, and 14.7\% unclassified infections. Multiple {HPV} types were detected in 25.7\% of study participants. {HPV} prevalence was higher in Brazil (72.3\%) than in the United States (61.3\%) and Mexico (61.9\%). {HPV}16 (6.5\%), {HPV}51 (5.3\%), and {HPV}59 (5.3\%) were the most commonly detected oncogenic infections, and {HPV}84 (7.7\%), {HPV}62 (7.3\%), and {HPV}6 (6.6\%) were the most commonly detected nononcogenic infections. Overall {HPV} prevalence was not associated with age. However, significant associations with age were observed when specific categories of {HPV}, nononcogenic, and unclassified {HPV} infections were considered. Studies of {HPV} type distribution among a broad age range of men from multiple countries is needed to fill the information gap internationally with respect to our knowledge of {HPV} infection in men.},

	abstract = {Currently, two prophylactic human papillomavirus ({HPV}) vaccines targeting {HPV} 16 and 18 have been shown to be highly efficacious for preventing precursor lesions although the effectiveness of these vaccines in real-world clinical settings must still be determined. Toward this end, an ongoing statewide surveillance program was established in New Mexico to assess all aspects of cervical cancer preventive care. Given that the reduction in cervical cancer incidence is expected to take several decades to manifest, a systematic population-based measurement of {HPV} type-specific prevalence employing an age- and cytology-stratified sample of 47,617 women attending for cervical screening was conducted prior to widespread {HPV} vaccination. A well-validated polymerase chain reaction ({PCR}) method for 37 {HPV} genotypes was used to test liquid-based cytology specimens. The prevalence for any of the 37 {HPV} types was 27.3\% overall with a maximum of 52\% at age of 20 years followed by a rapid decline at older ages. The {HPV} 16 prevalences in women aged {\textless}= 20 years, 21-29 years or {\textgreater}= 30 years were 9.6, 6.5 and 1.8\%, respectively. The combined prevalences of {HPV} 16 and 18 in these age groups were 12.0, 8.3 and 2.4\%, respectively. {HPV} 16 and/or {HPV} 18 were detected in 54.5\% of high-grade squamous intraepithelial (cytologic) lesions ({HSIL}) and in 25.0\% of those with low-grade {SIL} ({LSIL}). These baseline data enable estimates of maximum {HPV} vaccine impact across time and provide critical reference measurements important to assessing clinical benefits and potential harms of {HPV} vaccination including increases in nonvaccine {HPV} types (i.e., type replacement).},

Type-specific {HPV} prevalence rates are presented in relation to age as well as cytological and histological findings at entry. In all, 24 510 women had adequate cytology and {HPV} results. Cytology results at entry were: 87\% normal, 11\% borderline or mild, 1.1\% moderate and 0.6\% severe dyskaryosis or worse. Prevalence of {HPV} decreased sharply with age, from 40\% at age 20–24 to 12\% at 35–39 and 7\% or less above age 50. It increased with cytological grade, from 10\% of normal cytology and 31\% of borderline to 70\% mild, 86\% moderate, and 96\% of severe dyskaryosis or worse. {HPV} 16 or {HPV} 18 accounted for 64\% of infections in women with severe or worse cytology, and one or both were found in 61\% of women with severe dyskaryosis but in only 2.2\% of those with normal cytology. The majority of young women in Greater Manchester have been infected with a high-risk {HPV} by the age of 30. {HPV} testing is practicable as a primary routine screening test, but in women aged under 30 years, this would lead to a substantial increase in retesting and referral rates. {HPV} 16 and {HPV} 18 are more predictive of underlying disease, but other {HPV} types account for 30\% of high-grade disease.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h2{\textgreater}Summary{\textless}/h2{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}Cervical cancer is caused by human papillomavirus infection. Most human papillomavirus infection is harmless and clears spontaneously but persistent infection with high-risk human papillomavirus (especially type 16) can cause cancer of the cervix, vulva, vagina, anus, penis, and oropharynx. The virus exclusively infects epithelium and produces new viral particles only in fully mature epithelial cells. Human papillomavirus disrupts normal cell-cycle control, promoting uncontrolled cell division and the accumulation of genetic damage. Two effective prophylactic vaccines composed of human papillomavirus type 16 and 18, and human papillomavirus type 16, 18, 6, and 11 virus-like particles have been introduced in many developed countries as a primary prevention strategy. Human papillomavirus testing is clinically valuable for secondary prevention in triaging low-grade cytology and as a test of cure after treatment. More sensitive than cytology, primary screening by human papillomavirus testing could enable screening intervals to be extended. If these prevention strategies can be implemented in developing countries, many thousands of lives could be saved.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Background.  The ongoing development of a vaccine against human papillomavirus ({HPV}) raises important questions about the impact of various vaccination strategies.
        Methods.  Two mathematical models are developed to explore the population-level impact of an {HPV} vaccine. The first model focuses on the infection process and the second on the disease process (specifically, cervical carcinoma in situ and cancer).
        Results.  Both population characteristics (ie, sexual mixing and rates of sex partner change) and vaccine characteristics affect the steady state prevalence of {HPV} that would be expected if a vaccine program is implemented. Under a particular set of assumptions, we find that vaccinating both men and women against a specific {HPV} type would result in a 44\% decrease in prevalence of that type whereas vaccinating only women would result in a 30\% reduction. We also find that if a vaccine gives protection against some, but not all, high risk types of {HPV}, the reduction in disease may be less than the reduction in {HPV} because the remaining high risk {HPV} types may replace the disease caused by the eliminated types.
        Conclusions.  A multivalent vaccine containing the majority of disease-causing {HPV} types would greatly reduce the need for colposcopy, biopsy and treatment. However, it is unlikely that Pap-screening programs would become redundant unless the vaccine is highly effective and coverage is widespread. In contrast to less common infections that are primarily restricted to core groups, targeting the vaccine towards the most sexually active individuals is less effective for a common sexually transmitted infection such as {HPV}.},

	abstract = {Background: Anal human papillomavirus ({HPV}) infection, most notably of {HPV}16, the central cause of anal cancer, is increased by anal sexual intercourse and worsened by {HIV}-positivity.
Methods: We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies reporting type-specific anal {HPV} infection in men, according to sexual preference, {HIV} status and, when available, anal cytopathology. {HPV} prevalence was compared by prevalence ratios ({PR}).
Results: 79 eligible studies were included, comprising 23,700 men: 1,805 {HIV}-negative men-who-have-sex-with-women ({MSW}), 924 {HIV}-positive {MSW}, 8,213 {HIV}-negative men-who-have-sex-with-men ({MSM}) and 12,758 {HIV}-positive {MSM}. In analyses irrespective of anal cytopathology, {HPV}16 prevalence was significantly higher in {MSM} than {MSW}, both among {HIV}-negative (14\% versus 3\%; {PR} 4.7, 95\%{CI} 2.5-8.9) and {HIV}-positive men (30\% versus 11\%; {PR}=2.8, 95\%{CI} 1.9-4.1). Likewise, {HPV}16 was significantly higher in {HIV}-positive than {HIV}-negative men, both among {MSW} ({PR}=3.5, 95\%{CI} 1.6-7.7) and {MSM} ({PR}=2.1, 95\%{CI} 1.8-2.5). Anal {HPV}16 prevalence was similar between {HIV}-positive {MSW} and {HIV}-negative {MSM} ({PR}=1.3, 95\% {CI} 0.9-2.0). For {MSM}, anal {HPV}16 prevalence was significantly higher from studies with anal cytopathology, suggesting population sampling effects.
Conclusion: Sexual preference and {HIV} infection are independent and similarly strong determinants of male anal {HPV}16 infection, confirming {HIV}-positive {MSM} as priorities for anal cancer prevention.},
